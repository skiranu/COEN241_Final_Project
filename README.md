# COEN241_Final_Project
The use of chatbots in different spheres of modern life is widely common. They help us make bookings for travel, order things online, provide financial assistance for 
simple transactions, and many more. Despite such common prevalence, we saw a need for a chatbot in our universityâ€™s admissions office. 
The purpose of our chatbot is to help students get answers to their questions instantaneously when applying to the university. 
It also helps lessen the burden of people working in the admissions office.
